1 0:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,360 Hi.
2 0:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,280 Yes, everything is fine.
3 0:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,880 We're leaving soon.
4 0:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,480 I came to you only because of Misha.
5 0:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,960 He believes that I have serious issues.
6 0:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,280 Hope is a beautiful woman and...
7 0:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,520 works on private flights.
8 0:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,520 I'm afraid to think what they do to her on those flights.
9 0:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,720 We have a teenage daughter.
10 00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,280 He loves you and believes everything, and you are deceiving him.
11 00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,160 I also love Dad very much. I never deceive him.
12 00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,640 Sometimes I fly off the handle, which is normal for people.
13 00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,520 Sometimes you act really weird.
14 00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,520 Like it's not you anymore, but someone completely different,
15 00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,160 someone I don't know.
16 00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,840 Sit down.
17 00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,560 I want to get you out of here.
18 00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,000 But you'll have to do whatever I tell you to do.
19 00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,360 I said, run!
20 00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,440 I can't do this anymore. I'd have already been released from prison by now.
21 00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,760 I gave you freedom.
22 00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,600 You call this freedom?
23 00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,800 Mom!
24 00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,160 Let me go.
25 00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,320 Nothing will change for you.
26 00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,400 
27 00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,560 I need to disappear.
28 00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,400 I need to have three passports made.
